# Validate OSCAL Documents

The codebase provides a library for validating an OSCAL document (Profile, Catalog, SSP, etc.) against the official schema files. It only supports XML. The code in [this repository](https://github.com/vitg-gsa-automation/chkschema) has inspired this work.

## Why the library?

So other developers can use it in their applications easily.

## What to expect in the future?

Here are the "I hope I can do" items:

[] Support all OSCAL versions (v1.0.0 to v1.0.3)
[] Push the library as a NuGet package
[] Support JSON and YAML
[] Support error messages with line numbers and helpful feedback

## How can you help?

It is an open-source project, so please contribute away.
